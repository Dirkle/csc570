Running Code:
The code takes the following arguments to run

[directory in] [directory out] [primer sequence] [length to snip (~97-104 bases)]
[generation mode: (K)eyword,(H)istogram, (U)niform, (E)xhaustive] [number of samples to generate]  [pattern (Ex. 4,1,1,1)]

all of them must be present in order for the code to run and will print an error message if all 7 arguments are not present.
There is not much error checking on the arguments currently so make sure you know what you are doing when you run the program
or you might have unexpected results.

The following is a description of each argument:
[directory in] : The directory containing the files that contain opterons to sample with.
[directory out] : The directory where the output will be stored (Files will be created like exhaustive.out, keyword.out, etc...)
[primer sequence] : Used to parse the files in the in directory. The primer sequence will be searched for and the following
                    characters will be returned.
[length to snip] : This is the number of characters that are returned after the primer sequence is found (we usually used around 100)
[generation mode] : The mode to generate with. See files or the report for a further description of the different types.
[number of samples to generate] : The number of samples that will be generated using random sampling. If (E)xhaustive has been
                                  selected as the genertion mode this number will be ignored.
[pattern] : This is the pattern that will be used to generate samples. The pattern denotes what ratio each opteron should be put in.
            For instance, with a pattern 3,4 3 opterons of one type will be put in the sample followed by 4 copies of a different opteron.
            Note that these numbers need to add up to 7 and no spaces can be used.
